Patent Claims to Mermaid Diagram Generator
A production-level legal AI tool that converts patent claims into USPTO-compliant technical drawings
Overview
This system automates the creation of patent drawings from patent claims text, solving a critical pain point in patent prosecution. Patent attorneys can input claim text and receive professionally formatted Mermaid diagrams that meet all USPTO requirements for patent drawings.
Legal Problem Solved: Patent drawings are expensive (typically $300-500 per figure) and time-consuming. This tool enables rapid iteration and cost-effective diagram generation during the patent drafting process.

Print-Ready Output: Optimized for patent office submission

Installation
Requirements

Python 3.8+
No external dependencies (uses only standard library)

Setup
bashgit clone https://github.com/[your-username]/patent-mermaid-generator
cd patent-mermaid-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (if any additional deps needed)
Usage
Command Line Interface
Single File Processing:
bashpython patent_drawing_generator.py claims.txt -o diagram.mmd
Batch Processing:
bashpython patent_drawing_generator.py patent_claims_folder/ -o output_diagrams/
Verbose Output:
bashpython patent_drawing_generator.py claims.txt -v
Example Input (Patent Claims Text)
1. A data processing system comprising:
   a processor (12) configured to receive input data;
   a database (14) operatively connected to the processor (12);
   a user interface (16) in communication with the processor (12);
   wherein the processor (12) is configured to process the input data and store results in the database (14).

2. The system of claim 1, further comprising:
   a display device (18) connected to the user interface (16) and configured to present processed data to a user.
Generated Output
The system generates:

Mermaid Diagram File (.mmd) - USPTO-compliant diagram code
Metadata File (.json) - Component analysis and statistics
Log Output - Processing details and any issues

Technical Architecture
Component Classification System
The system uses pattern matching to classify components into standard technical categories:

Process Components → Rectangle symbols [Component Name 12]
Database/Storage → Cylinder symbols [(Database 14)]
Decision Points → Diamond symbols {Decision 16}
Input/Output → Parallelogram symbols [/Interface 18/]
Display Devices → Display symbols [/"Display 20"/]
Network Nodes → Circle symbols ((Network 22))

Relationship Extraction
Identifies connections using legal language patterns:

"connected to", "coupled to", "in communication with"
"operatively connected", "electrically connected"
"configured to receive", "configured to send"

USPTO Compliance Engine
Ensures all output meets patent office requirements:

Enforces minimum font sizes (20px components, 24px labels)
Applies high-contrast color schemes (black on white only)
Uses thick, visible connection lines
Maintains consistent reference numbering

Legal Use Cases
Primary Applications

Patent Prosecution: Generate drawings during application drafting
Continuation Applications: Quickly create drawings for continuation filings
Office Action Responses: Generate amended drawings to address examiner comments
Patent Portfolio Management: Standardize drawing formats across applications

Time and Cost Savings

Traditional Method: 4-8 hours + $300-500 per drawing
This System: 5 minutes + $0 per drawing
ROI: Immediate cost savings and faster patent prosecution

Integration Opportunities

Document Management Systems: Batch process existing patent portfolios
Patent Drafting Software: Plugin for existing legal tools
Law Firm Workflows: Integrate into standard prosecution procedures

Code Quality Features
Production Standards

Type Hints: Full type annotation for maintainability
Dataclasses: Clean, structured data representation
Enum Usage: Type-safe component classification
Logging: Comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing
Error Handling: Graceful failure and recovery
